features:
  - Adds a new BYONF API extension to Neutron which allows operators to override
    the astara-orchestrator driver used to back a resource as well as the Glance
    image id to be used for the virtual appliance, on a per tenant basis.  This
    requires leveraging the Neutron database to store these associations, so a
    migration repository has been added to create the required tables there.

other:
  - In order to use the BYONF API, the Neutron database must be migrated to create
    the required astara_byonf table.  This can be accomplished by running
    ``neutron-db-manage --subproject astara-neutron upgrade head``.
